## Current Progress

- **Arithmetic Operations:**  
  - Perform binary (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and unary (negation) operations.

- **Lexing & Parsing:**  
  - Tokenization of input for numbers, arithmetic operators, and parentheses.
  - Parsing of tokens into an abstract syntax tree (AST).

- **Interpreting:**  
  - Evaluation of the AST to calculate arithmetic expressions.
  - Error detection and location reporting for syntax errors.

## What You Can Currently Do

- Run arithmetic expressions through the interactive console, for example:
  - `5 + 3`
  - `-2 * (4 + 1)`

- View immediate results of calculations and detailed error messages on faulty expressions.

## Snapshots

Snapshots of the program in action will be included below to demonstrate:
- The interactive shell processing valid arithmetic expressions.
- The error output when syntax errors are detected.
